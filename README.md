Tech

Rings-on-Map uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

AngularJS - is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.
WebPack - is a module bundler. WebPack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. WebPack provide development server and compile your code for production (minify, uglify etc).

. Install node_modules

Run npm install to setup the node_modules:

$ npm i
3. Run dev-server

Run npm start script to load webpack-dev-server:

$ npm start
4. See dev-server output

Open your web-browser at:

http://localhost:8080
Deploy to Production

Ones development is done, deploy the app to production, run:

npm run production
Deploy to Mobile (Android/iOS)

ToDo: Write instructions...

Valid Scripts

1. Run webpack dev-server - for development and debugging

use one of these commands:

npm start
npm run srv
npm run server
2. Run webpack - release development version (without minified/uglify)

use one of these commands:

npm run dev
npm run development
3. Run webpack production - release production version (with minified/uglify and preparation for mobile version)

use one of these commands:

npm run prd
npm run production
4. Clean - delete to dist folder ('www' directory) - may be necessary before deploying to production

use one of these commands:

npm run cln
npm run clean
